How to use: xmlToCSV

1. Make sure you have node installed on your computer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
	(May have to run with elevated permissions)

2. Make sure you have a mapping file called "mapping.csv" in the /mappingFile folder
- Each row of the FIRST(A) column of the mapping.csv file will correspond to the name of a column in the output csv in the order they appear in the mapping.csv
- Each row of the SECOND(B) column of the mapping.csv file will correspond to the field name in the xml files and outputed under the the corresponding column name in column A of the mapping.csv
- There will be one row per xml file in the output CSV

3. put all xml files into the /xml folder. (This will be the input folder)

4. Run (double click) the convertXmlsToCsv.bat file in the main folder.

5. A csv should appear in the /results folder called "converted{timestamp}.csv" containing the data from all the xml files in the /xml folder.
